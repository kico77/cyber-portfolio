# Room: Defensive Security Intro

**Date**: 09-11-2025

**Main Task**: Eexplore the world of defensive security. Uncover how defensive security teams play a pivotal role in protecting networks and organisations across the globe.

## Notes

Defensive security, known as **the blue team**, is used to prepare and proactively protect an organisation's IT infrastructure.  It is concerned with two main tasks:

- Preventing intrusions from occurring
- Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly

A **Security Operations Centre (SOC)** is a team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events.

**Digital forensics** is the application of traditional forensic science processes to digital devices. Digital forensics is used to preserve and analyse digital evidence to aide in the investigation of incidents, such as a breach.

**Incident response** flow:

Preperation -> Detection and Analysis -> Containment, Eradication and Recovery -> Post-Incident Activity -> Preperation

- Preparation

Creating the necessary resources and frameworks to handle an incident. This includes creating incident response teams, infrastructure to support in the incident response process, as well anything to help prevent the incidents, such as providing phishing awareness training.

- Detection & Analysis

Using tooling and processes to detect incidents and assess their scope and severity. Logs can be analysed for suspicious events.

- Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

Limiting the impact of the incident, such as preventing a virus from spreading and eliminate the cause and restore affected systems.

- Post-Incident Activity

Review the incident overall, how it was handled and could've been prevented. What were the learning points throughout the process? Do we need to provide further cyber awareness training?
