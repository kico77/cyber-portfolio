**Date**: 09-11-2025

**Main task**: Hack your first website (legally in a safe environment) and experience an ethical hacker's job.

## Notes

- TryHackMe uses a virtul machine to work along side my leaning

- My very first task is to hack my first website :) using there virtual machine that is running in the browser

- I have been provided a FakeBank user account and will be trying to hack this further via hidden URLs

- To find these hidden URLs I will be usijg a tool called dirb, this tool uses a brute-force approach, by taking a list of potential page names and testing one by one if they exist in your website 

- Using the dirb tool I could find a bank-deposit URL, this link allowed me to deposit $2000 into my account, and ending my first task and room
