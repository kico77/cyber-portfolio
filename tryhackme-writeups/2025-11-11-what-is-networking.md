# Room: What is networking?

**Date**: 11-11-2025

**Main task**: Begin learning the fundamentals of computer networking in this bite-sized and interactive module.

## Notes

Networks are simply things connected

The Internet is one giant network that consists of many, many small networks within itself

The first iteration of the Internet was within the ARPANET project in the late 1960s. This project was funded by the United States Defence Department and was the first documented network in action. However, it wasn't until 1989 when the Internet as we know it was invented by Tim Berners-Lee by the creation of the World Wide Web (WWW). It wasn't until this point that the Internet started to be used as a repository for storing and sharing information

Devices on a network are very similar to humans in the fact that we have two ways of being identified:

- Our Name
- Our Fingerprints

Now we can change our name, but we can't, however, change our fingerprints. Every human has an individual set of fingerprints which means that even if they change their name, there is still an identity behind it. Devices have the same thing: two means of identification, with one being permeable. These are:

- An IP Address
- A Media Access Control (MAC) Address -- think of this as being similar to a serial number.

**IP Addresses**

An IP address (or **I**nternet **P**rotocol) address can be used as a way of identifying a host on a network for a period of time

IP addresses can change from device to device but cannot be active simultaneously more than once within the same network

A public address is used to identify the device on the Internet, whereas a private address is used to identify a device amongst other devices

**MAC Addresses**

Devices on a network will all have a physical network interface, which is a microchip board found on the device's motherboard. This network interface is assigned a unique address at the factory it was built at, called a MAC (**M**edia **A**ccess **C**ontrol ) address
